The rules of Formula 1 provide for precise regulations regarding the cars themselves, and not just the form of the races. Each team races 2 race cars of its own design and a pilot. Intense competition leads to multiple discoveries of technical innovations. All fireballs are required to comply with the technical requirements of the regulations and pass an impact test. The regulations and racing series are under the auspices of the FIA ​​(International Automobile Federation). If the chassis of the car is created by their own designers, then the engines can be purchased from different manufacturers. Today’s car is made of carbon fiber with four wheels outside the case. The rear wheels are driven and the front wheels are driven. It is controlled by a car steering wheel, gas and brake pedals.</p>

Raised the hull sides, installed safety arches behind the cockpit. Clothing and shoes for riders made of non-combustible materials. A special head and neck protection system is used.

Marshals display yellow flags and “SC” signs. All pilots must slow down and line up behind the safety car at a considerable distance.<br>Overtaking at this time is prohibited except for direct instructions to the pilot to overtake the safety car. If an unforeseen deceleration occurs in a vehicle, overtaking is also permitted. You can overtake cars that have not yet left the pit lane before crossing the second line of the first line of the safety car. Or race cars entering the pit lane after crossing her first line of the first line of the safety car. Allowed to overtake a car standing in the pit lane.<br>If other riders are driving along the track between the leader and the safety car, they must overtake the safety car by a green signal and join the end of the general group in the next lap.

The resumption of the race is similar to the start of the safety car. All fireballs on the starting grid that are in front of the leader must pass the circle without overtaking and call on the starting grid behind the rest of the cars.<br>When the race stops on incomplete 2 laps, the start is considered invalid.<br>When stopping completed 2 laps or more, but less than 75% of the total laps, the start resumes in the order of finding the cars before stopping the race.
